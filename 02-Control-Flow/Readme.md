# 📁 Control Flow Programs

This folder contains control flow programs in C. These programs are designed to cover essential concepts like conditionals and loops. They help build a strong foundation in writing logic-based C programs.

## 📝 Programs in this folder

- Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero  
- Check if a number is even or odd  
- Leap year checker  
- Find the largest among two numbers  
- Find the largest among three numbers  
- Simple calculator using `switch`  
- Vowel or consonant checker  
- Sum of first _n_ natural numbers using `for` loop  
- Factorial of a number using `while` loop  
- Fibonacci series up to _n_ terms  
- Prime number checker  
- Reverse a number using `do-while` loop  
- Sum of digits of a number  
- Multiplication table of a number  
- Pattern printing using nested loops

## 📅 Planned Programs

I will continue to add new programs on control structures like nested loops, pattern generation, and loop control using `break`/`continue`. Stay tuned for more programs to come!
